# Adding repository links

In this guide, we'll talk about how to add repository links to components. This lets you quickly open them in your browser, e.g in GitHub, and skim through the source code of your components as you use them.

Note that if you have the repository locally available, you can also use the “Open in” button in Zeplin to view the source code in your favorite IDE/text editor.

☝️ _If you haven't created a Connected Components configuration file yet, check out our [getting started guides](/README.md#getting-started)._

Currently it's possible to links to GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. In this example, we'll add GitHub links to all the components in our configuration file. Here's the sample configuration file we'll use, with two components:

```json
{
    "plugins": [
        {
            "name": "@zeplin/cli-connect-react-plugin"
        }
    ],
    "projects": [],
    "styleguides": [
        "5cd486b18a64c1414be004fb"
    ],
    "components": [
        {
            "path": "src/components/Button/Button.jsx",
            "zeplinNames": [
                "Controls / Button / Primary"
            ]
        },
        {
            "path": "src/components/TextField/TextField.jsx",
            "zeplinNames": [
                "Controls / Text field / Primary"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Firstly, in our configuration file, we'll add a property called `github`. Within this property, we'll define our repository name like so:

```json
{
    …
    "components": [
        …
    ],
    "github": {
        "repository": "example/react-components"
    }
}
```

`repository` is the only property we need to define. For example, if your repository URL is `https://github.com/example/react-components`, the `repository` property would be `example/react-components`.

In addition, if you want your links to point to a specific branch of the repository, you can set the `branch` property like so:

```json
{
    …
    "components": [
        …
    ],
    "github": {
        "repository": "example/react-components",
        "branch": "develop"
    }
}
```

This is it! Now when we run `zeplin connect`, we should start seeing the “Open in GitHub” button in Zeplin:

For further details on how to customize your repository links, e.g. for GitHub Enterprise, Gitlab, Bitbucket, path for monorepos, check out the [Configuration file documentation](/CONFIGURATION_FILE.md#repositoryconfig).
